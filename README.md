A simple way of remembering the things that matter to you! (Well, maybe not, thi s isn't a good way and maybe a note app on a phone is a better choise)

## Reasoning behind the project

A sample and "meet on all roads" type of project, build using React. His purpose is not of being a production ready application, but simply to get some practice using React and styled-components. Also some type of "separation of concerns" seen on [MVP pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter) is present, but not as in a fully fledged application.

## Demo

## Instalation

As simple as running a few commands inside the terminal:

```bash
npm install # for installing all the necessary dependecies 

npm start # to start the developing server / this will open a new window in the default browser
```

## Contribuiting

Everyone is free to submit a pull request! It doesn't need to add some feature or anything advanced, just a fixed typo inside this README is enough! But in your PR you need to be concise about your change and respect a good conduit.
